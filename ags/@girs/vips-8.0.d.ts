        /**
         * An abstract base class to load and save images in a variety of formats.
         *
         * ## Load and save
         *
         * You can load and save from and to files, memory areas, and the libvips IO
         * abstractions, [class`Source]` and [class`Target]`.
         *
         * Use [func`Foreign`.find_load] [func`Foreign`.find_load_buffer] and
         * [func`Foreign`.find_load_source] to find a loader for an object. Use
         * [func`Foreign`.find_save], [func`Foreign`.find_save_buffer] and
         * [func`Foreign`.find_save_target] to find a saver for a format. You can then
         * run these operations using [func`call]` and friends to perform the load or
         * save.
         *
         * [method`Image`.write_to_file] and [ctor`Image`.new_from_file] and friends use
         * these functions to automate file load and save.
         *
         * You can also invoke the operations directly, for example:
         *
         * ```c
         * vips_tiffsave(my_image, "frank.anything",
         *     "compression", VIPS_FOREIGN_TIFF_COMPRESSION_JPEG,
         *     NULL);
         * ```
         *
         * ## Image metadata
         *
         * All loaders attach all image metadata as libvips properties on load.
         *
         * You can change metadata with [method`Image`.set_int] and friends.
         *
         * During save, you can use `keep` to specify which metadata to retain,
         * defaults to all, see [flags`ForeignKeep]`. Setting `profile` will
         * automatically keep the ICC profile.
         *
         * ## Many page images
         *
         * By default, libvips will only load the first page of many page or animated
         * images. Use `page` and `n` to set the start page and the number of pages to
         * load. Set `n` to -1 to load all pages.
         *
         * Many page images are loaded as a tall, thin strip of pages.
         *
         * Use [method`Image`.get_page_height] and [method`Image`.get_n_pages] to find
         * the page height and number of pages of a loaded image.
         *
         * Use `page_height` to set the page height for image save.
         *
         * ## Alpha save
         *
         * Not all image formats support alpha. If you try to save an image with an
         * alpha channel to a format that does not support it, the alpha will be
         * automatically flattened out. Use `background` (default 0) to set the colour
         * that alpha should be flattened against.
         *
         * ## Adding new formats
         *
         * To add support for a new file format to vips, simply define a new subclass
         * of [class`ForeignLoad]` or [class`ForeignSave]`.
         *
         * If you define a new operation which is a subclass of [class`Foreign]`,
         * support for it automatically appears in all libvips user-interfaces. It
         * will also be transparently supported by [ctor`Image`.new_from_file] and
         * friends.

         * Add a new loader to libvips by subclassing [class`ForeignLoad]`. Subclasses
         * need to implement at least [vfunc`ForeignLoad`.header].
         *
         * [vfunc`ForeignLoad`.header] must set at least the header fields of `out`.

        /**
         * The [class`Image]` class and associated types and macros.
         *
         * Images can be created from formatted files on disc, from C-style arrays on
         * disc, from formatted areas of memory, or from C-style arrays in memory. See
         * [ctor`Image`.new_from_file] and friends.
         * Creating an image is fast. libvips reads just enough of
         * the image to be able to get the various properties, such as width in
         * pixels. It delays reading any pixels until they are really needed.
         *
         * Once you have an image, you can get properties from it in the usual way.
         * You can use projection functions, like [method`Image`.get_width] or
         * [method`GObject`.Object.get], to get [class`GObject`.Object] properties.
         *
         * `.v` images are three-dimensional arrays, the dimensions being width,
         * height and bands. Each dimension can be up to 2 ** 31 pixels (or band
         * elements). An image has a format, meaning the machine number type used
         * to represent each value. libvips supports 10 formats, from 8-bit unsigned
         * integer up to 128-bit double complex, see [method`Image`.get_format].
         *
         * In libvips, images are uninterpreted arrays, meaning that from the point
         * of view of most operations, they are just large collections of numbers.
         * There's no difference between an RGBA (RGB with alpha) image and a CMYK
         * image, for example, they are both just four-band images. It's up to the
         * user of the library to pass the right sort of image to each operation.
         *
         * To take an example, libvips has [method`Image`.Lab2XYZ], an operation to
         * transform an image from CIE LAB colour space to CIE XYZ space. It assumes
         * the first three bands represent pixels in LAB colour space and returns an
         * image where the first three bands are transformed to XYZ and any
         * remaining bands are just copied. Pass it an RGB image by mistake and
         * you'll just get nonsense.
         *
         * libvips has a feature to help (a little) with this: it sets a
         * [enum`Interpretation]` hint for each image (see
         * [method`Image`.get_interpretation]); a hint which says how pixels should
         * be interpreted. For example, [method`Image`.Lab2XYZ] will set the
         * interpretation of the output image to [enum`Vips`.Interpretation.XYZ].
         * A few utility operations will also use interpretation as a guide. For
         * example, you can give [method`Image`.colourspace] an input image and a
         * desired colourspace and it will use the input's interpretation hint to
         * apply the best sequence of colourspace transforms to get to the desired
         * space.
         *
         * Use things like [method`Image`.invert] to manipulate your images. When you
         * are done, you can write images to disc files (with
         * [method`Image`.write_to_file]), to formatted memory buffers (with
         * [method`Image`.write_to_buffer]) and to C-style memory arrays (with
         * [method`Image`.write_to_memory]).
         *
         * You can also write images to other images. Create, for example, a temporary
         * disc image with [ctor`Image`.new_temp_file], then write your image to that
         * with [method`Image`.write]. You can create several other types of image and
         * write to them, see [ctor`Image`.new_memory], for example.
         *
         * See [class`Operation]` for an introduction to running operations on images,
         * see [Image headers](libvips-header.html) for getting and setting image
         * metadata. See [class`Object]` for a discussion of the lower levels.

        /**
         * An abstract base class for all objects in libvips.
         *
         * It has the following major features:
         *
         * - **Functional class creation**: libvips objects have a very regular
         *   lifecycle: initialise, build, use, destroy. They behave rather like
         *   function calls and are free of side-effects.
         *
         * - **Run-time introspection**: libvips objects can be fully introspected
         *   at run-time. There is no need for separate source-code analysis.
         *
         * - **Command-line interface**: Any vips object can be run from the
         *   command-line with the `vips` driver program.
         *
         * ## The [class`Object]` lifecycle
         *
         * [class`Object]`'s have a strictly defined lifecycle, split broadly as
         * construct and then use. In detail, the stages are:
         *
         * 1. [ctor`GObject`.Object.new]. The [class`Object]` is created with
         *   [ctor`GObject`.Object.new]. Objects in this state are blank slates and
         *   need to have their various parameters set.
         *
         * 2. [method`GObject`.Object.set]. You loop over the [struct`Argument]` that
         *   the object has defined with [func`Argument`.map]. Arguments have a set of
         *   flags attached to them for required, optional, input, output, type, and
         *   so on. You must set all required arguments.
         *
         * 3. [method`Object`.build]. Call this to construct the object and get it
         *   ready for use. Building an object happens in four stages, see below.
         *
         * 4. [method`GObject`.Object.get]. The object has now been built. You can
         *   read out any computed values.
         *
         * 5. [method`GObject`.Object.unref]. When you are done with an object, you
         *   can unref it. See the section on reference counting for an explanation
         *   of the convention that [class`Object]` uses. When the last ref to an
         *   object is released, the object is closed. Objects close in three stages,
         *   see below.
         *
         * The stages inside [method`Object`.build] are:
         *
         * 1. Chain up through the object's `build` class methods. At each stage,
         *   each class does any initial setup and checking, then chains up to its
         *   superclass.
         *
         * 2. The innermost `build` method inside [class`Object]` itself checks that
         *   all input arguments have been set and then returns.
         *
         * 3. All object `build` methods now finish executing, from innermost to
         *   outermost. They know all input arguments have been checked and supplied,
         *   so now they set all output arguments.
         *
         * 4. [method`Object`.build] finishes the process by checking that all output
         *   objects have been set, and then triggering the [signal`Object:`:postbuild]
         *   signal. [signal`Object:`:postbuild] only runs if the object has constructed
         *   successfully.
         *
         * [class`Operation]` has a cache of recent operation objects, see that class for
         * an explanation of [func`cache_operation_build]`.
         *
         * Finally, the stages inside close are:
         *
         * 1. [signal`Object:`:preclose]. This is emitted at the start of the
         *   [class`Object]` dispose. The object is still functioning.
         *
         * 2. [signal`Object:`:close]. This runs just after all [struct`Argument]` held
         *   by the object have been released.
         *
         * 3. [signal`Object:`:postclose]. This runs right at the end. The object
         *   pointer is still valid, but nothing else is.
         *
         * ## The [class`Object]` reference counting convention
         *
         * [class`Object]` has a set of conventions to simplify reference counting.
         *
         * 1. All input [class`GObject`.Object] have a ref added to them, owned by the
         *   object. When a [class`Object]` is unreffed, all of these refs to input
         *   objects are automatically dropped.
         *
         * 2. All output [class`GObject`.Object] hold a ref to the object. When a
         *   [class`GObject`.Object] which is an output of a [class`Object]` is
         *   disposed, it must drop this reference. [class`Object]` which are outputs
         *   of other [class`Object]`'s will do this automatically.
         *
         * See [class`Operation]` for an example of [class`Object]` reference counting.

         * [func`call]`, [func`call_split]` and [func`call_split_option_string]` are used

         * use these functions directly: every operation has a tiny wrapper function
         * which provides type-safety for the required arguments. For example,
         * [method`Image`.embed] is defined as:
         *
         * ```c

         * argc/argv array. This is the thing used by the `vips` main program to
         * implement the command-line interface.
         *
         * ## [class`Operation]` and reference counting
         *
         * After calling a [class`Operation]` you are responsible for unreffing any
         * output objects. For example, consider:
         *
         * ```c
         * VipsImage *im = ...;
         * VipsImage *t1;
         *
         * if (vips_invert(im, &t1, NULL))
         *     error ..
         * ```
         *
         * This will invert `im` and return a new [class`Image]`, `t1`. As the caller
         * of [method`Image`.invert], you are responsible for `t1` and must unref it
         * when you no longer need it. If [method`Image`.invert] fails, no `t1` is
         * returned and you don't need to do anything.
         *
         * If you don't need to use `im` for another operation, you can unref `im`
         * immediately after the call. If `im` is needed to calculate `t1`,
         * [method`Image`.invert] will add a ref to `im` and automatically drop it when
         * `t1` is unreffed.
         *
         * Consider running two operations, one after the other. You could write:
         *
         * ```c
         * VipsImage *im = ...;
         * VipsImage *t1, *t2;
         *
         * if (vips_invert(im, &t1, NULL)) {
         *     g_object_unref(im);
         *     return -1;
         * }
         * g_object_unref(im);
         *
         * if (vips_flip(t1, &t2, VIPS_DIRECTION_HORIZONTAL, NULL)) {
         *     g_object_unref(t1);
         *     return -1;
         * }
         * g_object_unref(t1);
         * ```
         *
         * This is correct, but rather long-winded. libvips provides a handy thing to
         * make a vector of auto-freeing object references. You can write this as:
         *
         * ```c
         * VipsObject *parent = ...;
         * VipsImage *im = ...;
         * VipsImage *t = (VipsImage **) vips_object_local_array(parent, 2);
         *
         * if (vips_invert(im, &t[0], NULL) ||
         *     vips_flip(t[0], &t[1], VIPS_DIRECTION_HORIZONTAL, NULL))
         *     return -1;
         * ```
         *
         * where `parent` is some enclosing object which will be unreffed when this
         * task is complete. [method`Object`.local_array] makes an array of
         * [class`Object]` (or [class`Image]`, in this case) where when `parent` is
         * freed, all non-`NULL` [class`Object]` in the array are also unreffed.
         *
         * ## The [class`Operation]` cache
         *
         * Because all [class`Object]` are immutable, they can be cached. The cache is
         * very simple to use: instead of calling [method`Object`.build], call
         * [func`cache_operation_build]`. This function calculates a hash from the
         * operations' input arguments and looks it up in table of all recent
         * operations. If there's a hit, the new operation is unreffed, the old
         * operation reffed, and the old operation returned in place of the new one.
         *
         * The cache size is controlled with [func`cache_set_max]` and friends.
